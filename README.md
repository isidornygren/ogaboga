Ogaboga is a syntheziser library written in rust based on the audio output library [cpal](https://github.com/tomaka/cpal), it's very dumb and you shouldn't really use it if you don't like to do fun stuff that's not terribly optimized.

It consists of a pulse modulator that takes an envelope and a waveform and can ouput a pulse based on that envelope.

The waveform is simply a function that takes a _clock_ that will be the _deltatime_ modulus the common period `2Ï€` and outputs a waveform accordingly, some examples like square, triangle and sawtooth are included.

A single voice will run in its own thread, so you'll need a voice pool to handle the communication between threads.

## Examples

See the examples/ directory in the source.

To run the examples, just check out the source and execute cargo run --example in the root directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/isidornygren/ogaboga.git
$ cd ogaboga
$ cargo run --example random
```

### Basic project example

Basic project that initiates a voice pool, and starts a loop that will pulse a random tone every second.

```rust
extern crate noise;
extern crate ogaboga;
extern crate rand;

use ogaboga::{Envelope, Voice, VoiceEvent, VoicePoolBuilder};
use rand::Rng;
use std::{thread, time};

fn main() {
    // Initiate the voice pool that we will initiate voices in
    let mut voice_pool = VoicePoolBuilder::new()
        .with_voice(Voice::new(&f32::sin, Envelope::new(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)))
        .build();

    loop {
        let sleep_time = time::Duration::from_millis(1000);
        thread::sleep(sleep_time);
        voice_pool
            .send(
                VoiceEvent::ChangeFreq(440.0 + rand::thread_rng().gen::<f32>() * 220.0),
                0,
            )
            .unwrap();
        voice_pool.send(VoiceEvent::Pulse, 0).unwrap();
    }
}
```

## TODO

- ~~Remove sample rate dependency on voice creation, as the format is deduced during thread creation.~~
- Tests
- ~~Integrate Travis~~
- Periodic 1D noice function
- ~~Rethink abstractions and fix library linking~~
- ~~Example(s)~~
- Make sure voice pool is thread safe
